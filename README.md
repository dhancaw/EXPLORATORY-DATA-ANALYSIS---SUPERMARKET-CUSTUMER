Prepared by Adhanto Bagaskoro for Purwadhika JCDS Program's Module 2 Final Project

Description
The dataset provides information on customer preferences and purchasing patterns, with a specific focus on the sales of Sweets, which is identified as a low-demand item in the supermarket. The analysis aims to identify insights and develop strategies to increase the sales of Sweets.

Contents
The dataset consists of the following files:

customer_data.csv: Contains customer information such as marital status, age, and number of children.
purchase_data.csv: Contains purchase information including the quantity and type of products bought, including Sweets.

Data Insights
The analysis of the dataset revealed several key insights:
The majority of customers who purchased Sweets below the average were married individuals (65%), followed by divorced individuals (25%) and single individuals (10%).
Approximately 29-30% of single customers purchased Sweets above the average, indicating their potential as a target market for increasing sales.
Age distribution within the single segment did not show a specific age group consistently purchasing Sweets above the average.
The segment of single customers proves to be an effective target market due to their likelihood of being direct consumers without considering children's preferences.


Usage
The dataset can be utilized for further analysis, such as developing marketing strategies and optimizing sales for low-demand products like Sweets. The provided customer and purchase data can be leveraged to gain insights into customer behavior and make data-driven decisions.
